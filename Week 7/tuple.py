# ----------------  TUPLES ----------------

# Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data.

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)  

# Accessing elements in a tuple
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[-1])  # Output: (5)

tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
combined_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2  # Concatenation
print(combined_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
